  dialogLines:
  - 'Waddle waddle! Ahoy there, land-strider! '
  - You look like someone who doesn't mind getting their boots a bit dirty.
  - 'This tropical sun is melting my brain-freeze! '
  - I need something to keep my spirits 'chill'.
  - Tell me, are you here to help a captain in distress, or are you just admiring
    my magnificent tuxedo?
  - "Listen, I\u2019ve heard rumors of these 'mushrooms' - weird little umbrellas
    growing out of the dirt!"
  - To a penguin like me, that's exotic gourmet!
  - 'Could you waddle over to the forest and snag some for me? '
  - I'll make it worth your while!
  - 'Splendid! Just make sure they aren''t the ''spin-your-head-round'' kind. '
  - Pingu wants a tasty snack, not a trip to the moon!
  - 'Fine, keep your dry boots! '
  - I guess I'll just starve in this heat while dreaming of forest snacks. Cold-hearted,
    truly!
  - Cold-hearted, truly!
  - My tummy is growling louder than a hungry leopard seal!
  - I'm craving the taste of the deep blue, but my flippers are too sore for diving
    today.
  - 'Cast your line and bring me a fresh catch! '
  - Something scaly and delicious, if you catch my drift!
  - 'Perfect! I''ll be waiting here, sharpening my beak. '
  - Don't let the big one get away!
  - "No fish? You\u2019re really leaving me high and dry! "
  - My tummy will remember this betrayal, land-strider! Waddle away then!
  - Still empty-handed?
  - Don't leave me out in the cold, pal!
  - "I\u2019m counting on you to bring those goodies back!"
  - 'Ice-tastic! You actually did it! You''re a real life-saver. '
  - Here, take this gold! Don't spend it all on snow-cones!
  - Phew, I'm stuffed! Give a penguin a break, will ya?
  - My digestion needs some 'me-time'. Come back in a bit!
