  - You're still digging in the dirt?
  - I just came back from the deep woods. I found something you might find... interesting.
  - I spotted some rare 'Moonlight Berries' near the waterfall. ?
  - They only grow where the shadows are thickest. Want the coordinates?
  - 'Go be careful. '
  - If the forest spirits catch you stealing their snacks, even Ian won't be able
    to help you. Good luck.
  - 'Domesticated crops are fine, but wild seeds have a ''kick''. '
  - They grow slower, but they sell for a lot of gold at the market.
  - 'I''ll keep an eye out for more during my scouts. '
  - Just make sure you have enough space in your backpack next time.
