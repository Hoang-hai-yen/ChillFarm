  - "Woof\u2014! Ahem, excuse my excitement. Greetings, traveler!"
  - My name is Shiba. My ears picked up your footsteps from a mile away!
  - "I am currently on patrol. A Shiba\u2019s duty is to keep this area safe from
    any... uninvited guests. "
  - Though, the sun is quite perfect for a nap, isn't it?
  - Keep your head high and your nose sharp, friend.
  - The world is full of wonders if you know where to look. Until we meet again!
  - 'A treat? For me?! Tail wags intensely '
  - ' My warrior training tells me to stay composed, but my stomach is singing a
    different tune! Is that dried salmon?'
  - 'Exquisite! A flavor truly fit for a Shogun! You have a kind soul, traveler. '
  - I shall remember this kindness until the end of my days!
  - 'Leaving already? I understand. Duty calls us both, I suppose. '
  - Walk tall, and may you never lose your way in the tall grass!
