  dialogLines:
  - Greetings, farmer.
  - I've been patrolling the perimeter. Your fences are holding up, but I can smell
    wild boars near the south ridge.
  - 'Don''t worry. As long as I''m Alpha, no pest will touch your pumpkins. '
  - But you should probably reinforce the gate before the moon is full.
  - 'Keep your shovel close and your eyes sharper. A farm is only as strong as its
    guardian. '
  - ' Stay alert.'
  - 'My claws are better for digging than planting, but I respect your hard work. '
  - The pack is grateful for the food you grow.
  - 'If you need heavy stones moved for your new barn, just howl. '
  - I'll send some of the younger wolves to help
  - 'Back to work. The sun waits for no one, and neither do the weeds. '
  - Move along.
